# ⚡ Fluxbase


Fluxbase is your modern, self-hosted project and data management tool. It gives you a smooth, spreadsheet-like interface to manage projects, organize data, and keep everything in one place — with performance and simplicity in mind.

> ⚠ **Note:** Fluxbase is built to run **only on a dedicated server or your own computer**.  
> It will not work properly on platforms like Vercel, Render, Railway, or inside Docker containers, because those environments don't provide reliable local file storage.

## 🖥️ Recommended Hardware

Fluxbase is lightweight but benefits from stable, persistent storage and a decent processor.
Here’s what we recommend:

### Recommended for Production (Dedicated Server / VPS)

- CPU: Quad-core or better (Intel Xeon, AMD Ryzen, or similar)
- RAM: 4–8 GB (more if you have many users/projects)
- Storage: 20+ GB SSD (fast read/write improves performance)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar Linux distro (most reliable for servers)
- Backup: External storage or automated snapshot backup recommended
